# Ethical-Network-Sniffing
Sniffing with Ettercap

In this project, I used the Ettercap tool to perform network sniffing and monitoring activities. The primary goal was to capture and analyze network traffic for educational purposes and to understand the mechanics of network communications.

Process:

    I set up Ettercap on my Kali Linux system, using the IP address 192.168.1.x (my own system's address) within my private network.
    The sniffing process was conducted ethically on my own network and system to avoid any unauthorized activity. This project was strictly for educational and cybersecurity learning purposes, ensuring no harm was done to others.
    After launching Ettercap, I performed an ARP spoofing attack to intercept traffic between the devices on my network. This allowed me to capture various packets, including sensitive information like HTTP requests, DNS queries, and other communications.
    The captured data was analyzed for potential vulnerabilities and insights into network behavior.

Ethical Considerations:

    The operation was conducted in a controlled, private network environment where I have full permission to carry out such activities. No external systems or users were targeted during this process.

Results:

    Successful packet capture and analysis of communication between devices on my network.
    Identification of potential weaknesses in network security and data transmission protocols.

This experiment was conducted to deepen my understanding of network security and to practice ethical hacking techniques within a safe and legal context.
